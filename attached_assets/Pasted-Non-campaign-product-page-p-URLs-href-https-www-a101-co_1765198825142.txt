Non-campaign product page (_p URLs)
href="https://www.a101.com.tr/kapida/..._p-11000229"


Differences vs campaign cards:

URL contains _p- → this indicates a single product, not a campaign.

Nested structure includes price, discount badges, h3 titles → typical product card.

Class names contain product-container → product, not a campaign.

Campaign cards do not have _p- in URL.

Campaign cards usually go directly to /kapida/<campaign-slug>.

✅ Rule: Skip any <a> where href contains _p- or /product/.

2️⃣ Banner / informational link
<a class="w-full" title="En Yakın Mağazalar" href="/en-yakin-magazalar">


Differences:

URL does not contain /kapida/ → not a campaign.

Usually links to static pages or informational pages (stores, services, etc.).

Often contains full-width images, not slider swiper-slide elements.

✅ Rule: Only consider <a> inside a swiper-slide whose href contains /kapida/.

3️⃣ Poster / flyer link
<a class="flex cursor-pointer flex-1" href="/afisler-hadi">


Differences:

URL does not contain /kapida/.

Wrapped in rounded divs with aspect ratios like aspect-[368/100] → poster, not product/campaign.

Usually contains dates as text, like “6-12 Aralık”.

Often not inside the main slider element.

✅ Rule: Exclude <a> whose href does not match /kapida/.

4️⃣ Campaign card (actual)
<div class="swiper-slide ...">
  <a href="https://www.a101.com.tr/kapida/haftanin-yildizlari">
    <img src="...jpg" />
  </a>
</div>


Key identifying features:

Inside a swiper-slide div (slider carousel).

<a> href contains /kapida/, but no _p-.

Direct image <img> shows campaign visual.

Optional: can infer title from URL slug.

✅ Rule for campaigns:

div.swiper-slide a[href*="/kapida/"]:not([href*="_p-"])

✅ Summary / Filtering Strategy

Only consider <a> inside a swiper-slide.

href must contain /kapida/.

href must NOT contain _p- (single products).

Ignore links outside slider or banners (/en-yakin-magazalar, /afisler-hadi, etc.).

Optional: verify <img> exists inside <a> to ensure visual content.
